*Whiteboard for drawing your ideas together - Java & SuM library*

This program was created for an assignment at school and includes
an image editor that serves to open, edit and save images.
Panit can also be used as a whiteboard using the server function.
This allows multiple users to access and modify the image.
Heavily relies on the German educational SuM library. 

## Disclaimer

To be able to read the code of this project, one might need experience with the SuM library,
as well as basic understanding of the German language, 
since its the language nearly all of SuM's function/variable names are written in.

Its a spaghetti mess based upon the shaky foundation that the SuM library provides.

## TODOS
