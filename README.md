*Whiteboard for drawing your ideas together - Java & SuM library*

This program was created for an assignment at school and includes
an image editor that serves to open, edit and save images.
Panit can also be used as a whiteboard using the server function.
This allows multiple users to access and modify the image.
For all functions we use the German library
[__SuM__](https://www.mg-werl.de/sum/), which is used for school use.
